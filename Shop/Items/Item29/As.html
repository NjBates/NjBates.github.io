                        <h4>The Amazing Spiderman</h4>
                        <p>Set a few months after the events of the film, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy sneak into the restricted areas of Oscorp after hours, where Gwen reveals her suspicions that they may be continuing the cross-species experiments of Dr. Curt Connors, who had become the monstrous Lizard. They are caught by Alistair Smythe, the new Oscorp director, who confirms Gwen's suspicions, although the cross-species carry a powerful virus and are to be disposed. However, the cross-species all react to the presence of Peter, a cross-species himself, and break out, infecting all of the scientists, including Smythe and Gwen, in the process. Smythe unleashes his security robots, which are programmed to defend them from cross-species. Peter quickly dons his Spider-Man suit and gets the infected to quarantine, fighting off the robots and destroying the S-01 in the process, but is unable to stop the cross-species and the virus from escaping into the city.</p>
                        <p>Spider-Man goes to the Beloit Psychiatric Hospital, and seeks the help of the incarcerated Connors to develop a cure for the virus. Connors relents, but only if he is returned to the asylum when the crisis is resolved. They set up a laboratory at the apartment of Aunt May's friend Stan, and begin development of an antidote, while keeping in close contact with Gwen and Smythe via webcam. At the same time, Smythe is developing his own "cure" which involves nanobots destroying the host from the inside out. Spider-Man also forms an alliance with Whitney Chang, an investigative reporter who believes Oscorp's facelift operation is a scam, in unveiling the suspicious activities of Oscorp.</p>
                        <p>Connors manages to create an antidote, which Spider-Man delivers to Gwen, however a skeptical Smythe decides to test it on himself; he unexpectedly loses the use of his legs as well as his sanity, and, in a fit of rage, programs his robots to eliminate Spider-Man. Returning to Connors after narrowly escaping the robots, in the process destroying the S-02, a heavily injured Spider-Man berates Connors about the antidote's failure before passing out from his injuries. Since Spider-Man retains his humanity despite being a cross-species, Connors uses Spider-Man's blood to create a more accurate antidote. Spider-Man travels to Oscorp and manages to cure Gwen and the other scientists with the antidote. Meanwhile, the CDC quarantines the city with the advancement of the virus.</p>
