                        <h4>Hyrule Warriors</h4>
                        <p>During Cia's siege on Hyrule Castle, a cucco farmer named Linkle receives word of the invading army. Believing that she is the newest incarnation of the legendary hero, she equips her grandmother's compass and sets off for the castle accompanied by her cuccos. However, her poor navigational skills causes her to travel in the wrong direction, and she is attacked by Skull Kid, who attempts to steal her compass. During the struggle, Linkle discovers the compass has magical properties and reclaims it, setting off once more. As she continues to get lost, she runs into many of the heroes from Hyrule's past and aids them, such as helping Fi prevent the Imprisoned's summoning, protecting Ruto and Darunia from an ambush by Volga's forces, and briefly restoring Midna to her true form. Finally, she arrives at Hyrule Castle just after Ganon is defeated and assists Impa in protecting it from the remaining monsters. When they are attacked by an invincible Dark King Dodongo, Linkle's compass suddenly reacts and purifies the creature, allowing them to defeat it and drive the monsters off. Linkle joins the celebration with the rest of the army as Link and Zelda return from restoring the Master Sword to its pedestal.</p>
                        <p>Shortly thereafter, Lana is attacked by an unknown figure, who steals the Triforce of Power. At the same time, a new rift is opened and pulls pieces of the landscape from the Great Sea into Hyrule, with many of the islands fusing together. At Impa’s request, Link goes to the Forsaken Fortress to investigate, where he meets Tetra and aids her in fighting off the gathering monsters. As the enemy retreats, Tetra is abducted by the Helmaroc King. Link pursues the bird to the Gerudo Desert and rescues Tetra with help from Lana, who arrives to close the open Gates of Souls and find clues as to why Cia vanished. King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule appears to them and explains that an evil from his and Tetra's world is responsible for the recent events. The four journey to the Temple of Souls, where they are attacked by the forces of a dark impostor of Cia. Lana frees the real Cia from the darkness, who explains her magic was stolen after her defeat by Phantom Ganon, the true mastermind behind the recent events, which had caused her to disappear. The group tracks him to his hideout, a fusion of the Earth and Wind Temples, and defeat him. As he dissipates, Cia’s magic is returned to her and the Triforce of Power is released from his body, which Lana returns to Cia. Tetra and the King are returned to their native time, and Cia is brought back to the castle, where she, Link, and Zelda use their combined Triforce pieces to restore Hyrule to normal. Having made peace with everyone, Cia returns with Lana to the Valley of Seers to watch over the Triforce together.</p>
